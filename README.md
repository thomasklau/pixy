## About
Pixy is a lightweight application for generating image datasets intended for downstream machine vision applications. With a few image labeling functions, pixy is able to achieve near human accuracy for image turking. For more information about pixy, read "Computer Vision Through Perception: Semantic Understanding of Novel Scenes through Data Programming" (Lau and Guo, 2016).

## Requirements
Pixy depends on DeepBox, pycaffe, caffe, snorkel, and vlfeat. Instructions to install each of these libraries can be found online. It is highly recommended to install these libraries on Ubuntu.

# TODO:

Thomas: Finalize code for using numpy sparse matrix to generate true labels

Michelle: Set up root SIFT, get visual words, be able to compute the distance between two sets of visual words

Later: Set up edgebox, set up tensorbox, finalize training dataset examples
