## About
Pixy is a lightweight application for generating image datasets intended for downstream machine vision applications. With a few image labeling functions, pixy is able to achieve near human accuracy for image turking. For more information about pixy, read "Computer Vision Through Perception: Semantic Understanding of Novel Scenes through Data Programming" (Lau and Guo, 2016).
